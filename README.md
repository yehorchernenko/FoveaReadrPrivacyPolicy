# Privacy Policy — FoveaReadr

**Effective date:** February 9, 2026

FoveaReadr (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app may collect, including for AI features powered by third-party services, and how it is used.

## Summary
- We do **not** sell your personal information.
- Subscriptions are processed by **Apple**. We do not receive your full payment details.
- AI features use a **third-party AI provider (OpenAI / ChatGPT API)**. Text you submit to AI features is sent to that provider to generate results.
- Your **AI chat history, reading text, URLs, and documents are stored on your device only**. If you choose an AI action (for example, “Summarize with AI”), the relevant content is shared with the AI provider to complete your request.
- If you contact support, we only use what you send to help you.

## Information We Collect

### 1) Information you provide
**Support requests.** If you email us, we receive the information you include (such as your email address and message). We use it only to respond and provide support.

### 2) Purchases and subscriptions
Subscriptions are handled by **Apple** through your Apple ID. We may receive non-identifying purchase status signals (e.g., whether a subscription is active) to unlock features, but we do not receive your credit card number or billing details.

### 3) App content stored on your device
FoveaReadr stores the following **on your device only**:
- AI chat history (your prompts and the AI responses shown in-app)
- Reading text/content you add or open
- URLs you save or open in the app
- Documents you import or create in the app

We do not upload this content to our servers by default.

**When content is shared:** If you choose an AI action (for example, **“Summarize with AI”**), the relevant content (such as selected text, a document, or a URL you asked to summarize) will be sent to our AI provider to generate the requested output.

### 4) AI features (ChatGPT API / OpenAI)
FoveaReadr includes AI-powered features (for example: summarization, explanations, rewriting, or insights).

When you use an AI feature, we send the following to **OpenAI (ChatGPT API)** to generate the response:
- The content you choose to process (such as selected text, pasted text, document, or a URL you requested)
- Your prompt/instructions (what you ask the AI to do)
- Limited technical data necessary to process the request (e.g., language, app version)

**Third-party processing**
- OpenAI processes this information to return the AI output.
- Your AI input (and the AI output) may be handled according to OpenAI’s policies and terms.
- Because AI requests are processed by a third party, **data you submit to AI features may be stored or used by that third party** as described in [their documentation/policies](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/).

**Important:** Do not submit sensitive personal information (e.g., passwords, financial info, government IDs, private medical details) to AI features.

### 5) Analytics and diagnostics (optional)
We may collect basic diagnostic information (such as crash reports) to improve stability and performance. This data is used to fix bugs and improve the app.

## How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Provide and maintain the app
- Respond to support requests
- Improve performance and reliability (e.g., fix crashes)

## Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information only:
- With **OpenAI** when you use AI features (to generate AI outputs)
- With service providers that help us operate the app (e.g., crash reporting), solely to perform services on our behalf
- If required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security

## Data Retention
- Support emails: kept as long as needed to resolve your request and for reasonable record-keeping.
- Diagnostics data: retained only as long as needed for troubleshooting and product improvement.
- App content (chat history, text, URLs, documents): stored on your device unless you choose an AI action that sends relevant content to the AI provider.
- AI inputs/outputs: may be processed and retained by us and/or OpenAI as needed to provide the AI feature and operate the service.

## Your Choices
- You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app.
- You can manage subscriptions through Apple (Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions).
- If the app provides AI controls, you can choose not to use AI features.

## Children’s Privacy
FoveaReadr is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the effective date above.
